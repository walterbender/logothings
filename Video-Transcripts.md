<a name="Logo-Goals"></a>

We tried to achieve a number of goals. First of all, that it should be easily accessible. There should be corners of the language that you can get into, like baby talk getting into English that are easy for the youngest beginner. But it shouldn't be a toy language. It's not that Logo is easy--it's easy to get into--but once you're in there you can progress to the most sophisticated ideas in the world of programming. Just as in English you can start off with baby talk but the same language is also the vehicle for expression of poets and philosophers.

<a name="Education-Theory"></a>

And one of the troubles with education theory until recently is that people have this idea that the best way to learn is to make it a positive experience. Everything should be good, the child should be guided to make very small steps so that they can't make any serious mistakes, and then you learn everything, and then when you're all done you can do the job without thinking because you know exactly what to do. Well, I don't think that kind of learning leads to becoming very good at new problems because you haven't learned enough about bugs. So what we've really got to do is teach children to enjoy being wrong.
