# Marvin Minsky Speaks

## Marvin Interviewed in 1995

In 1995 Marvin was interviewed by [Paul
Hoffman](https://lsc.org/about-us/executive-staff) for Discover's TV
program [Discovering Great Minds of
Science](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Great-Minds-Science-VHS/dp/157523453X). The
interview was about 40 minutes. I have extracted short clips and
posted them here.

Paul Hoffman asks Marvin if he built machines as a child. He talks
about Tinkertoys.
